Hello Cyberworld!

My name is Gary, and I'm trying to be another speck of dust on the moon. I have been a computer technician, IT professional, Web Developer, and pioneered local internet access for a rural community in the 1990s, but I never learned to truly code until recently. It's a sad and lonely life in a sea of millions of fish. 1 developer is 1 among 100s of millions, and they all know more than I do. :\
